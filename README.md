# Luc Ah-Hot CS302 - Artificial Life Final Project

The main changes in this repo from the base diffTaichi repo is in the main function and some of the creature initialization functions right above it. Depending on what creature I was trying to spawn in, I was using either initialize_worm() or initialize_crawler() where both would take in the scene variable and the number of segments or legs depending on which creature we are spawning. 

Things to take note are that the number of total rectangles does change depending on the creature as the worm does not have a main "body" whereas the crawler does so the number of rectangles has to be adjusted accordingly. Also, for the actuators, I tried to only have 2 for the crawler to represent the quadricep and hamstring of each leg with the main body not having any actuation. And so I set the scene actuators to 2, whereas for the worm, each segment will have its own actuator so that also needs to be adjusted. Lastly, the worm uses phase offsets in the compute actuation function to delay actuations based on the location of the segment in the body, and so there is a line to set the phase offset to 0 or not depending on if a crawler or a worm is being instantiated. 

These are the main changes I made for this project.
